The running scripts are in the local/chain/adaptation/running_adaptation.sh.
They are based on the TDNN and CNN-TDNN systems, thus please complete the building of them first, 
  e.g., our experiments in the paper are based on the local/chain/tuning/run_tdnn_7q.sh and local/chain/tuning/run_cnn_tdnn_1a.sh.
