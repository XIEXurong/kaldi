This is the modified version of Kaldi toolkit for Bayesian adaptation approaches in the published paper:
	Xurong Xie, Xunying Liu, Tan Lee, & Lan Wang (2021). Bayesian Learning for Deep Neural Network Adaptation. IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing.
which is originally proposed in the paper:
	Xurong Xie, Xunying Liu, Tan Lee, Shoukang Hu, & Lan Wang (2019, May). BLHUC: Bayesian learning of hidden unit contributions for deep neural network speaker adaptation. In IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP) (pp. 5711-5715).

The codes are mainly based on src/nnet3, please find the running examples in egs/swbd/s5c.
